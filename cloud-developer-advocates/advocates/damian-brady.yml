  ## Bio
  Damian is a Cloud Developer Advocate specializing in DevOps. After spending a year in Toronto, Canada, he returned to Australia - the land of the dangerous creatures and beautiful beaches - in 2018.

  Formerly a dev at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) and a Microsoft MVP, he has a background in software development and consulting in a broad range of industries. In Australia, he co-organised the Brisbane .Net User Group, and launched the now annual [DDD Brisbane](http://dddbrisbane.com) conference. He regularly speaks at conferences, User Groups, and other events around the world, and is an occasional guest on various podcasts like [.NET Rocks](https://dotnetrocks.com) and [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com).

  Most of the time you'll find him talking to developers and IT Pros to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategies.

  Damian has his own [Channel 9](https://channel9.microsoft.com) show - [The DevOps Lab](https://aka.ms/devopslab). Check it out for real-world guidance on implementing DevOps in your organisation!
